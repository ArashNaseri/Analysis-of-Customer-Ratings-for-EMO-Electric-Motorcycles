# Analysis-of-Customer-Ratings-for-EMO-Electric-Motorcycles
This project was undertaken as a mandatory component of the practical examination, aimed at fulfilling and completing the requirements for the DataCamp Certification in Data Scientist Associate.


## Background
EMO is a leading manufacturer of electric motorcycles, which launched its first electric motorcycle in India in 2019. The company's product team has been soliciting ratings from website users to gain insights into the motorcycles' quality and identify areas for improvement. The ratings provided by both owners and non-owners are valuable to the product team for different reasons. Ratings from owners help the team to improve the quality of the motorcycles, while ratings from non-owners can help identify new features that can attract new customers.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer ratings for EMO electric motorcycles and predict whether the ratings were given by owners or non-owners. This analysis will provide valuable insights into customer perceptions of EMO electric motorcycles and inform future product development efforts.

## Methodology
To achieve the objective, we will use a supervised learning algorithm called logistic regression to build a classification model that can predict whether a rating came from an owner or a non-owner. The following steps will be taken in the methodology:

**Data Collection**: The customer ratings data from EMO's website was already given, including data such as the rating score, the reviewer's name, and the reviewer's ownership status (owner/non-owner). The dataset also includes other relevant information such as the make and model of the moped, the month of the review, the web browser used by the reviewer, the age of the reviewer, and the primary use of the moped.

**Data Cleaning** : We will clean the data to remove any missing or incorrect values and remove duplicates.

**Feature Engineering**: We will create new features that could help improve the classification model's performance, such as the number of times a reviewer has rated EMO's motorcycles, the reviewer's location, and the type of motorcycle reviewed.

**Model Development**: We will split the data into training and testing sets and use logistic regression to develop the classification model. We will evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Model Optimization**: We will use techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to optimize the model's performance.

**Model Validation**: We will validate the model's performance using an independent test dataset.

## Results
The results of the analysis will provide insights into customer perceptions of EMO electric motorcycles and inform future product development efforts. The classification model developed in this project can be used to predict whether a rating came from an owner or a non-owner with high accuracy, allowing the product team to identify areas for improvement and new features that can attract new customers.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aimed to analyze customer ratings for EMO electric motorcycles and predict whether the ratings were given by owners or non-owners. Through the use of logistic regression, we were able to develop a classification model that can predict ownership status with high accuracy. The insights gained from this analysis can inform future product development efforts and help EMO to continue to improve the quality of its electric motorcycles and attract new customers.
